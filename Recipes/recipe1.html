    <h1>Fried Rice</h1>
    <img src="" alt="Delicous fried Rice">
    <p>This is a Fried Rice recipe I have used for the past five years as a base. Fried Rice is a form of base food, where ingriedients can change based on whats sitting in your fridge.
        You do not need a wok, but a pan that can very evenly distributed heat like cast iron will work very well. It also pays to chop things ahead of time, so one can add ingridients at a good time to ensure crispiness.
        I reccommend brunoice cut(dicing into cubes, doesnt have to be precise) for most of the vegatables, outside of the ones specified otherwise.
