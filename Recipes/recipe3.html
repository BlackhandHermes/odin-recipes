    <h1>Mushroom Soup</h1>
    <img src="/Images/mushroomsoup.jpg" alt="delicious mushroom soup">
<p>This is a mushroom soup I have made for my family several times. I used to call it scrap soup because I used to clear out the fridge of older veggies and wilty mushrooms. After some time, we upgraded it to have a better
    flavor and more consistent ingriedients. One can even add cream if one desires a different taste profile. Soup is somethign you want to create in layers, to maximize flavors and textures. Do it slow, and watch as your soup turns to deliciousness!</p>
